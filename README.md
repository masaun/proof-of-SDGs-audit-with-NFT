# Proof of SDGs🌍🌿 / Proof of Achievement for SDGs🏅

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

<br>

## 【Test】
- Run all of tests
```
npm run test
```
( `npx hardhat test --network hardhat` )
